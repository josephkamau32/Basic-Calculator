# Basic Calculator Program üßÆ

## Description
A simple Python program that performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) on two user-input numbers.

## Features
- ‚ûï Addition (`num1 + num2`)
- ‚ûñ Subtraction (`num1 - num2`)
- ‚úñÔ∏è Multiplication (`num1 * num2`)
- ‚ûó Division (`num1 / num2`)
- üö´ Input validation (handles non-numeric inputs gracefully)

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x installed on your system

## Installation
No installation required. Just download the script and run it.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository or download the script:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/basic-calculator.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd basic-calculator
   ```
3. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python calculator.py
   ```
4. Follow the on-screen prompts to enter two numbers.

## Example Output
```
Enter the first number: 10
Enter the second number: 5

Results of your two numbers:
Sum: 15.0
Difference: 5.0
Product: 50.0
Quotient: 2.0
```

## Code Structure
```python
# Basic Calculator Program

# Get user input
num1 = float(input("Enter the first number: "))
num2 = float(input("Enter the second number: "))

# Perform calculations
sum_result = num1 + num2
difference_result = num1 - num2
product_result = num1 * num2
quotient_result = num1 / num2

# Display results
print(f"\nResults of your two numbers:")
print(f"Sum: {sum_result}")  # ‚ûï
print(f"Difference: {difference_result}")  # ‚ûñ
print(f"Product: {product_result}")  # ‚úñÔ∏è
print(f"Quotient: {quotient_result}")  # ‚ûó
```

## Error Handling
The program currently converts user input to floats. To improve it, you could add:
```python
try:
    num1 = float(input("Enter the first number: "))
    num2 = float(input("Enter the second number: "))
except ValueError:
    print("Error: Please enter valid numbers!")
    exit()
```

## Future Enhancements
- [ ] Add more operations (exponents, modulus)
- [ ] Implement a GUI version
- [ ] Add history of calculations
- [ ] Support for complex numbers
